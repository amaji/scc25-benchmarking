  - Teams are encouraged to submit their questions as issues on the `benchmarking repo <https://github.com/StudentClusterCompetitionSC/SCC25-Benchmarking/issues>`_ for the SCC25 competition. This way, all the conversations will be visible to every team and we can avoid repeating the same questions.

  - If you need assistance with a bug in the MLPerf inference code, or MLPerf automation, please open an issue in the appropriate MLPerf repository. The title should start with `**[SCC25]**` to direct the questions to MLPerf judges for SCC25.
